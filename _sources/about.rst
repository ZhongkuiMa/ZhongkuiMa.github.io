About
======

I'm Zhongkui Ma.

I'm a PhD student at
`the University of Queensland <https://www.uq.edu.au/>`_ (UQ).
I'm fortunate to be supervised by A/Prof.
`Guangdong Bai <https://baigd.github.io/>`_.

`Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=r2Z7bCMAAAAJ>`_.


I'm a one hundred percent math amateur, and I'm interested in various mathematical
models, especially those related to neural networks.
My current research focuses on neural network verification, especially verifying neural
networks by over-approximating convex hulls, i.e., constructing linear constraints
for the non-linear neural network.

My Research Interests
----------------------

2024 - Current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is my second year of PhD study.
I have began to develop our verification tool for some time, which is mainly implemented
by
`Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ (some parts are dependent on
`Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_
and
`pycddlib <https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/>`_).

Our paper `ReLU Hull Approximation <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632917>`_
about neural network verification
has been accepted by
`POPL'24 <https://popl24.sigplan.org/room/POPL-2024-venue-kelvin-lecture>`_,

Our paper (with `Zihan Wang <https://www.zihan.com.au/>`_)
`CORELOCKER: Neuron-level Usage Control <https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2024/313000a222/1WPcYMh3F1C>`_
about model version control
has been accepted by
`S&P'24 <https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/accepted-papers.html>`_.

Our paper (with Xinguo Feng)
`Uncovering Gradient Inversion Risks in Practical Language Model Training <?>`_
about Gridient Inversion Attack (GIA)
has been accepted by
`CCS'24 <?>`_.

2023 - 2024
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I began my PhD study in January and am supervised by A/Prof.
`Guangdong Bai <https://baigd.github.io/>`_.
I focus on neural network verification, specifically verifying neural networks by
over-approximating convex hulls.
I also collaborate with my colleague, Xinguo Feng,
`Zihan Wang <https://www.zihan.com.au/>`_
on other topics like
*gradient inversion*
and
*model pruning*.
I'm very interested in theoretical proofs about neural networks on any topic.
I published a paper about
`ReLU Hull Approximation <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632917>`_
in
`POPL'24 <https://popl24.sigplan.org/room/POPL-2024-venue-kelvin-lecture>`_
(This is real a great honor for me because you know it is hard),
which shows a critical idea of how to construct the convex hull of a function.
The main used libraries are
`Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_ (
`linear programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`_
optimization)
and
`pycddlib <https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/>`_ (
`double description algorithm <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61576-8_77#:~:text=The%20DD%20method%20is%20an,equivalently%20A%20has%20rank%20d.>`_
).

2022
~~~~

I finished my master's thesis, and it is about verifying neural networks by abstract
interpretation, leveraging polyhedral abstract domains and programming methods
specifically (
`DeepPoly (POPL'19) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290354>`_,
`k-relu (NIPS'19) <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/0a9fdbb17feb6ccb7ec405cfb85222c4-Paper.pdf>`_,
`PRIMA (POPL'22) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3498704>`_
).
I focused on propagation-based models and LP (
`linear programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`_
)-based models.

2021
~~~~

I started studying for my master's degree at Queensland University (UQ), majoring in
Information Technology.
My main focus was on course study, and I learned Java programming and algorithms in
depth.

2019 – 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~

I taught myself machine learning, especially deep learning.
I have thought deeply about deep learning principles and have a certain understanding
of various models.
This is inspired by my best friend, Shupeng Geng.
During this period, I also taught myself various introductory courses on algebraic
geometry, including commutative algebra, homology algebra, algebraic geometry,
computational algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and algebraic number theory
(Because I think this is my obsession before my post-graduate studying).

2017 – 2018
~~~~~~~~~~~

I was honored to follow my supervisor,
Dr. `Haixin Ding <http://www7.zzu.edu.cn/glxy/info/1501/5201.htm>`_,
at `Zhengzhou University <http://www.zzu.edu.cn>`_,
to
learn about
`system dynamics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics>`_
(`Vensim <https://vensim.com/>`_),
`agent-based models (ABM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model>`_
(`Repast Simphony <https://repast.github.io/>`_),
`structural equations modeling <https://en.wikipedia
.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling>`_
(`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_),
and
`factor analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis>`_
(`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_).
During this period, I read many books on sociology and philosophy, most of which
involved communication, sociological research methods, and metaphysics.

My undergraduate thesis researched consumer perception using factor analysis and web
crawling methods.
In this period, I began to love research and I hope to become a PhD.

2015 – 2016
~~~~~~~~~~~

I taught myself various basic mathematical models and mathematical software (many
software including the `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com>`_,
`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_,
`SPSS <https://www.ibm.com/spss>`_,
`LINGO <https://www.lindo.com/index.php>`_, ...
I just learn the basic usage of these software, not the advanced usage in that time.
),
including differential equation models, optimization models, statistical models,
machine learning models, algorithms, and more.
I started participating in various mathematical modeling competitions and won various
awards (I think they are not worth mentioning).

2014 - 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~

I started studying for my undergraduate degree at
`Zhengzhou University <http://www.zzu.edu.cn>`_,
majoring in marketing.
I taught myself undergraduate mathematics and statistics introductory courses, including
mathematical analysis, advanced algebra, advanced geometry, ordinary differential
equations, complex functions, functional analysis, probability theory, mathematical
statistics, stochastic processes, time series, and discrete math etc.
