About
-----

Hi there! I'm Zhongkui Ma (马中奎), currently diving deep into my PhD journey at
`the University of Queensland <https://www.uq.edu.au/>`_.
I'm fortunate to be supervised by A/Prof.
`Guangdong Bai <https://baigd.github.io/>`__.
Also, welcome to visit our lab,
`TrustLab <https://uq-trust-lab.github.io/>`_.

Recent Small Interests
----------------------

I'm currently working on some exciting tools that I'm thrilled to share with you:

- `shapeonnx <https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/shapeonnx>`_: A tool to **infer the shape of an ONNX model** when the official tool is down. It's a simple yet powerful tool that helps you understand the dimensions of your model's inputs and outputs!

- `slimonnx <https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/slimonnx>`_: A tool to **optimize and simplify your ONNX models** by removing redundant operations and resolving version issues. It makes ONNX files cleaner, more efficient, and ready for action!

- `torchonnx <https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/torchonnx>`_: A tool for **converting ONNX models** to **PyTorch models** (``.pth`` for parameters, ``.py`` for structure). It's simple, lightweight, and designed for seamless model conversion.

- `torchvnnlib <https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/torchvnnlib>`_: A tool to **convert VNN-LIB files** (``.vnnlib``) to **PyTorch tensors** (``.pth`` files) for efficient neural network verification. Take full advantage of the PyTorch ecosystem.

- `propdag <https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/propdag>`_: A **bound propagation framework** for **neural network verification**. It supports any **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** structure, covering both **feedforward** and **backward** propagation patterns for verification. This tool allows researchers to focus on their algorithms without worrying about complex computation graphs.
